## Welcome to eleanor

The purpose of eleanor is to go from [TESS](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/) Full Frame Images (FFIs) to extracted and systematics-corrected light curves for any given star observed by TESS. In its simplest form, eleanor takes a TIC ID, a Gaia source ID, or (RA, Dec) coordinates of a star observed by TESS and returns, as a single object, a light curve and accompanying target pixel data. There’s plenty of customizability along the way, though: you can examine intermediate data products, change the aperture used for light curve extraction, and much more. The quickstart tutorial goes through these procedures in more detail.
